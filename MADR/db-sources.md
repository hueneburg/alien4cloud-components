# What sources should be used for the DB research

* Status: accepted
* Deciders: Armin HÃ¼neburg
* Date: 2018-09-03

## Context and Problem Statement

There are many possible sources to get potential databases to consider.
The decision should be limited to a few but should also cover many databases.

## Considered Options

* Google
* db-engines
* nosql-database
* Wikipedia
* Searching Apache, Eclipse, Github (what is offered)
* Datamining of Apache, Eclipse, Github (what is used)
* Datamining of jobs (what is searched)
* Trends (Twitter, Google)

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "db-engines" combined with "nosql-database", because both sides offer a great selection of databases with many small and newly 
developed ones. db-engines also includes many of the sources like Google hits, Google Trends, Twitter Trends, and what is searched for in jobs.

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

* Many of the proposed sources partly included
* Lots of variety

### Negative consequences <!-- optional -->

* Focus on NoSQL databases
